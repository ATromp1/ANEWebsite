// TODO LIST

-- Player summary on an event on the event homepage

-- Add a list containing players who selected Late
-- Implement late button. Perhaps make it popup a screen where players can fill in minutes.
    This data will be shown to officers when making the roster

-- Have event details boss button change depending on if a roster has been selected

-- check if user is not logged in as admin account before loading chars into database



BUGS

-- Fix display when loading from loading roster from database

-- Players will get removed from the selected roster as well when they sign off from a raid. Do we want to keep
    that functionality?




PRODUCTION

-- Some urls are still coded to localhost
-- Change some of the cdns to their production version
