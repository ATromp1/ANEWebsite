// TODO LIST

-- Player summary on an event on the event homepage

-- Add a list containing players who selected Late

-- Implement late button. Perhaps make it popup a screen where players can fill in minutes.
    This data will be shown to officers when making the roster




BUGS

-- Players will get removed from the selected roster as well when they sign off from a raid. Do we want to keep
    that functionality?
    
    @malp
        Probably, if they're not going to show up to raid then they shouldn't be on the roster for that raid




PRODUCTION

-- Some urls are still coded to localhost
-- Change some of the cdns to their production version

-- WSGI + gunicorn or uwsgi on linux
