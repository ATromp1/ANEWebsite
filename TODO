// TODO LIST

-- Player summary on an event on the event homepage

-- Add a list containing players who selected Late

-- Implement late button. Perhaps make it popup a screen where players can fill in minutes.
    This data will be shown to officers when making the roster


-- remove all characters from bench when one is selected ( all characters with same account id)


BUGS

-- Boss nav bar will not show if someone in the roster does not have a class. Lets make it skip that person if it has
no selected class so it still renders.




PRODUCTION

-- Some urls are still coded to localhost
-- Change some of the cdns to their production version
-- add site domain to "Sites" in admin and bnet application

-- WSGI + gunicorn or uwsgi on linux
